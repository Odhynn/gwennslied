## 4817, late autumn

> *Incipit.*
> *It was not in the least how I expected things to unfold, but may it be.*
> *I had decided to follow a lead right after my pilgrimage to the Four Winds and Ekteron.*
>*The Wolf Legion was still anchored on the coast, and Lord Hida graciously arranged for me to be discreetly ferried to the shores of Olgizmar; his heart still aches over the Realms, and though he knows not the details of our quest, he understands why we roam.*

### Session 01 / 2024-11-15

Imprisoned, without due process, in the Vaelkith Correctional Facility mines.
Reverend [[Soraelis]], [[Dante]], and [[Laslath]] have been here for three.

Ο επιστατης [[Augustus Vaelkith]] δε δειχνει σημασια στο ποστο του.
Προ ημερων καποιος ηρθε και τον προειδοποιουσε, τον απειλουσε πως δεν ειχαν ιδεα οι μαγιστροι τι καναν εκει και οτι προκαλουν την καταστροφη, πως δεν ξερουν με τι μπλεκουν και οτι επρεπε να φυγουν αμεσα.

The mining golems were sent forward nonetheless to undertake the heavy duty drilling, followed by mages that stabilised the mining shafts.
Then the labourers went in, for more manual processing and refinement, and to sniff out cold iron veins. That was us and about 60 more prisoners, comprised of undesirables and low-priority death-row inmates, made to waste away in the dark.

Kαποιοι σκληροπετσοι ειχαν κανει συμμορια:

> [!info] the Quarterers
> Οσοι περνανε καποιες δοκιμασιες και μπαινουνε στη συμμορια, το ενα τεταρτο της δουλειας τους την κανουν αλλοι.
> Their chief is an orc tiefling by the name of Bolg.

**Soraelis** complied stoically with the extra work; **Gwenn** and **Dante** had come to blows with them instead.

The mines are connected with the surface through a portal. Every week 5-6 guards with bracelets came to check, bring supplies in and take ore crates out.

## 4817, Graymist 12th

Μας καλει ο [[Augustus Vaelkith]].
A clockwork golem worker stopped responding in the depths.
He wants us to scout out, track it down and drag it out.
The guards are unwilling to do it themselves.
> *It's bound to be quite hazardous then. And we 're more expendable.*

We are given back our gear.
> *My sword and naginata blade are still in there. Sweet relief.*

The inmates look on curiously as we pass and head into the tunnels.

After trudging in the dark with **Gwenn**'s halo lighting the path, we find the golem wrecked, with a great depression on its side.
A stone in the same shape lies nearby: probably what took it out.

A breach on the cavern walls reveals broken brickwork.
**Soraelis** casts *Light* on a stone and throws it; a segment of the brickwork suddenly animates and crushes the stone in flight. 
After a brief pause, **Laslath** casts *Light* on a stone and throws it.
> *Only a fool would repeat the same thing twice and expect different results. Or perhaps Rowena.*

The floating brickwork likewise crushes the second stone in the air and turns, aggravated, towards **Gwenn**.
> *For the record, good sir, whatever you are, I cast no stone. I kept my light upon my crown.*

> [!danger] Siege Shard
> We advance to the animated brickwork, shields up. 'Tis a Siege Shard, imbued with strong feelings of a battle, visions of which blow through us as it strikes and shrieks.
> Like a restless ghost it will return to life after destruction; it needs to be put at rest.
> **Laslath**'s dazing spells confound it, and it finally falls by **Gwenn**'s hand.
> She kneels by its remains and lays it at peace.

> `Gwenn`
> Be at peace. The siege that haunted thee is over. So much so, that it has nearly passed out of memory. By the grace of the Observer, I consign thee to rest.

Σκοτεινο δωματιο διαφαινεται μεσα απο ανοιγμα, εκει που ηταν το Siege Shard.
A banner, worn and tattered, a bit of red drape, stale air.

We enter an ancient hall, lined with statues of outsiders, each pair opposed in the cosmic sense. Angel, devil, vethian, fey, agathion, demon, kenemi, fire elemental, water elemental, dragon, elf.
At the end lies a mural, depicting all the creatures, hands raised towards a big crystal in the centre.

> [!tldr] Ancient Mural
> *This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!*
> *This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing of value is here.*
> *What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.*
> *The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center.*
> *The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.*
> *The danger is to the soul, and it can kill.*
> *The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.*
> *The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited. Unless all is lost to the demons, do not choose this option.*
> *Never again.*

Another mural lies in another room, too damaged to decipher; the symbol of the siege
can be made out in the dust, as can recent footprints.

Following the tracks we come upon Bolg and three more Quarterers.
**Soraelis** talks loudly and they hear us.
Despite our previous confrontations, Bolg speaks civilly.
They were offered the same deal by Augustus, and rolled down here to scout out the place. There was a door that closed behind them, and a bit of loot they found.

We warily part ways with them, and push on to explore a dark corridor.
An undead suddenly rises inside the side room.

> `Deathless priest of Amehan`
> Why are you here? this place was supposed to never be breached.

### Session 02 / 2024-12-12

> [!danger] Undead Priests
> Amehanite summons more undead priests from the side room.
> We hold the entrance and then lunge to him, shields raised.
> **Gwenn** hacks 3 crits through the priests.

**Soraelis** finds spent Wyrsa crystals in the corner.
Illusory wall hides adamantine door with 2 romboid alcoves.
In 3 rooms lie 3 symbols of Voolthow, Amehan, and Neverborn.

Voices rise from behind the door: the Quarterers.
Ψαχνουν ενα δευτερο κρυσταλλο και μιλανε για εσοχες, σαν αυτες που μολις ειδαμε στην αδαμαντινη πυλη. Θαρρουν πως εχουμε πεθανει.
Τους συνανταμε στο διαδρομο, κρατουν ενα κρυσταλλο που εκπεμπει φως, και μετα απο αλλη μια διπλωματικη στιχομυθια κινουν προς την αλλη κατευθυνση.

We move to the hall they just came out of, two great statues lie within, with corresponding inscriptions in empyrean and diabolic.
- Empyrean: "I open at the closing"
- Diabolic: "I close at the opening"

**Soraelis** muses about "darkness from light and light from darkness "and a profound rumble shakes the depths.
As we turn to leave, we witness a pair of giant constructs hunting the Quarterers towards us. We flee around the side rooms where the undead priests were, letting the constructs pass us by, and keep running in the opposite direction.

On the narrow hallway we come across a crypt of Grand Priest Thorgrim of Yerastu.
Just a bit further, a tomb of an Archpriest of Sergonial.
> The definition of antithesis, is this place; it insists on putting cosmological opposites side by side so, that the centerpiece must either be a shrine to absolute balance or really, really dangerous. 

At the end of the corridor, we emerge into a hall with a dwarven statue, and then another lined with symbols of Nahema, Reszek, and Yerastu.
A mummified cleric of Reszek rises to address us while the Quarterers flee. Our hands are stayed by the sheer oxymoron of his existence.

> `Deathless priest of Reszek`
> The negative binding has been destroyed.
> By disturbing this place you have endangered the world itself.
> We have an hour at most to react; you must take the gauntlet.
> This thing in the inner chamber, many have wished for and has been shut there so none may possess it.
> It now must be sent to another dimension. 
> I will call the priests, but one mortal must take the gauntlet.
> When things are ready, you must then throw it into the portal.

We rush down the hallways, passing by sarcophagi of rising dwarven priests, with no time to dwell on the blame.
Finally coming to a stop in a secluded room at the end, over a dark altar we witness a gauntlet that hovers, made of void glass.
**Soraelis** deems **Gwenn** the most suited to carry this artifact towards the portal to the Fortress of the Just that the undead priests shall open.
**Gwenn** crosses herself and takes up the gauntlet, and immediately all magic is suppressed on her by its power.

The Quarterers suddenly emerge from around the corner and throw an acid flask at her.
> `Bolg`
> "Sorry boys, business is business."

> [!danger] the Quarterers
> *Grease* is cast underneath the feet of **Gwenn** and **Dante**, as the two scrappers Ennia and Bolg move up to shove us into it.
> The caster Grick on the back lobs a *Flaming Sphere* to torment **Soraelis**.
> The alchemist Johnathan throws one grenade after the other.
> **Gwenn** holds her ground against hits and grenades, a *Force Barrage* fizzles against the gauntlet. Ennia keeps trying to knock her down in vain.
> A bitter, prolonged scuffle finally ends with the Quarterers on the back foot, and breaking into a rout when Bolg falls.
> We run down 3 of them; the alchemist escapes behind a door that the undead priest warned us to ignore.

### Session 03 / 2024-12-15

Return to the undead priests assembling, **Dante** and **Soraelis** backtrack to retrieve one of the crystals from Bolg's body.
Βρισκουν τον αλχημιστη κοκκαλωμενο στην πορτα, κατι μεσα του ειπε λεει να μην κουνησει μεχρι να καταλαβει τι συμβαινει. Οταν μια φωνη στα σκοτεινα οντως ρωτα αγριεμενα "με ποιον μιλας", κλεινουν την πορτα και γυρναν.

Καθως οι ιερεις κλιμακωνουν, τρεχουμε προς την πυλη με τις δυο εσοχες.
Over there stand [[Augustus Vaelkith]], a strange horned lady, and a pair of golem hulks.

The [[Strange Woman]] playfully scolds Augustus over being hasty; he had invited her over finding something big and this is not it.
As we enter the room, Augustus tries to make a show for some progress and nervously prods us to cooperate, yet is met with our disdain after the Quarterers' attack, apparently on his orders.
The [[Strange Woman]] is amused by the altercation, and hungrily observes the gauntlet artifact on **Gwenn**'s arm. Μας προσπερνα και παει να μιλησει με τους ιερεις σαν ακουει πως μας στειλαν εδω, ετσι απλα.

> `Gwenn`
> Who are you?
> `Strange Woman`
> All in good time, sweetie.

Defeated, Augustus slids down to the floor and curses his day.
Περα απο την πυλη, σαν ανοιξει με τα δυο πετραδια στις εσοχες της, κειται τεραστιος βωμος πανω στον οποιο ενας σπασμενος κρυσταλλος αιωρειται τρεμαμενος.
Γυρω του πλεουν θραυσματα υλης, σαν εκρηξη που παγωσε στον χρονο.

**Gwenn** slowly paces through the time-stopped field, protected by the gauntlet, and grabs the crystal from its mid-air suspended state; it subtly cracks on her touch, and time begins flowing again as the field around the alter fades away.

We rush back to where the deeathless priests were opening a portal to the Fortress of the Just, only to witness a scene of carnage: most of the priests lay strewn across the floor, the Reszekine barely standing while the [[Strange Woman]], unscathed, addresses him flanked by her golems.  

> `Strange Woman`
> Get busy answering or get busy dying, darling.
> `Deathless priest of Reszek`
> The artifact is not meant for you. Or anyone.
> `Strange Woman`
> You would have it hidden somewhere, forgotten, doing nothing; I would rather put it to use, to the benefit of Olgizmar, to push against the demon plight. I must have it.

> [!danger] the Horned Magister and her 2 Golems
> The golems advance on **Gwenn**, activate defences, and pummel her raised shield.
> The Deathless Reszekine casts *Divine Wrath*, frying one of the golems, but the Horned Magister phases out and dodges the spell entirely.
> Glimpsing the portal at the end of the room, **Gwenn** makes a desperate dash for it through the Golems but is knocked over by one. Exhausted by her wounds and the lack of magical healing ever since she put on the gauntlet, she drops on the floor and the crystal escapes her grasp.

Time seems to slow.
The [[Strange Woman]]'s eyes widen, and she immediately teleports away
> *Uttering a perfectly cut expletive, I might add.*

Απο το ραγισμενο πετραδι εκτινασσεται εκτυφλωτικο φως.

---

> [!example] Vision
> Ξυπνω στην επιφανεια.
> Ουρανος κατακοκκινος, γεματος καπνους.
> Το γαντι ειναι ακομα στο χερι μου.
> Tall, crumbling, alien structures tower in the distance.
> The ground beneath my feat is blackened as if by an explosion.
> A giant crater gapes ahead.
> 
> A silhouette stands against the fiery horizon light, of red skin and mixed, mismatched artificial tissue.
> 
> > `V2`
> > I have a question to ask; why make something aligned with destruction to save the world?
> > This is the only way it could have ended.
> > War no longer needed its ultimate practicioner. It had become a self-sustaining system.

> > Samsara of cut sinew and crushed bone.

> > No final words, no concluding statement.
> > No point.
> > Perfect closure.
> > `Gwenn`
> > Am I dead?
> > `V2`
> > No.
> > `Gwenn`
> > If not, then how did I get here? What is this?
> > `V2`
> > These are the bloodied skies of the Final War, where the world feeds on itself. Far at the end of your world's future, yet you witness it by virtue of the divine eye that shattered in your hands.
> > `Gwenn`
> > The eye of a god... Of Veth?
> > `V2`
> > Good. You're picking up fast.
> > `Gwenn`
> > Who are you? *What* are you?
> > `V2`
> > I was one of those who held Veth's Eye to you;a piece of it is lodged in your heart.
> > I am designated [[Unit V2]], created for the final war; and now, your guide.
> > Perhaps you may help this boring future not come to pass.

Ανακταμε τις αισθησεις μας και οι τεσσερις σε αμμωδη παραλια, διπλα σε ναυαγιο αρχαιο που ξεβρασε η θαλασσα.
Ο [[The First to Speak|τυπος]] που ειχε ερθει και προειδοποιουσε τον επιστατη να κλεισει τα ορυχεια στεκεται απο πανω μας.

**Gwenn** looks to her punctured breastplate: a shard of the Eye of Veth is indeed lodged deep in her sternum.
**Soraelis** and **Dante** are also pierced with shards of their own.
The fungal leshy **Laslath** has taken on aquatic coral features, and the creature addresses her.

> `The First To Speak`
> Primordial One.
> We many are in disarray.
> We many have no beginning and no ending.
> The Primordial One sacrificed himself to save you, has absorbed the blast, has transferred its conscience to you.
> I am the first to speak.
> [ ... ]
> Our creator gave us one task and duty: keep the demons out.
> Η τελευταια οδηγια του Primordial One ηταν να σας σωσω.
> [ ... ]
> Γνωριζω ο,τι γνωριζει το Σμηνος, αλλα το Σμηνος δεν γνωριζει και πολλα.

Dazed, **Gwenn** stands up and looks to the hand that wore the gauntlet.
> *'Tis now crude inside, creaking, ticking. Like a regeneration gone awry.*
> *A replacement. The beginning of a likeness to the [[Unit V2|mechanical daemon]].*
> *Visions of the future, his time, under bloody skies: I am like this. All of me.*
> *The horror. The horror.*

Στον νυχτερινο ουρανο, το βορειο σελας παλλεται.
> *[[The First To Speak]] said that they were keeping the demons out.*
> *Is that barrier broken? Did we do this?*

Judging by the stars, we are lying on the southwest coast.
In the horizon, beyond the sandbanks, a city glows ablaze in the night.
It is [[Bránstraž]].
> *Grave is our sin. The horror.*
> *Observer have mercy, for we acted not with reckless curiousity, but good faith: we sought to keep it from the magisters. From the moment they sniffed the cold iron, this was inevitable.*
> *Nonetheless, we did this. And my hand...*
> *I shall accept my penance. Help me make this right.*
> *Observer. Lady Luna. Ancestor spirits. Have mercy.*
